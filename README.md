Killerzx is a Python based project that boldly exploits Discord's API, wearing the badge of "legal" and "TOS-friendly" or we like to say so. It's a tool designed for those who want to venture into Discord's API while staying undetected and secure, especially when paired with the use of residential proxies.

At its core, Killerzx serves as a means of unlocking the potential of Discord's API with a sense of daring, all while acknowledging the importance of privacy and anonymity. We know how vital it is to operate within the boundaries, or at least pretend to, which is why Killerzx plays nice with proxies, ensuring your actions within Discord's API remain as covert as a spy in the night.

Here are some key aspects of Killerzx:

1. **Advanced TLS Integration:** Killerzx utilizes tls_client to establish secure connections, because, you know, security is essential, even when you're being cheeky.

2. **Proxy Shenanigans:** When combined with proxies, Killerzx takes your privacy to another level, making it nearly impossible for anyone to trace your digital footsteps. Not that we're encouraging mischief, of course, wink wink.

3. **Diverse Module Set:** Killerzx features a range of modules, each designed to expand your capabilities within Discord's API while maintaining a low profile, or at least trying to.

4. **User Friendly Design:** We've gone out of our way to make Killerzx user friendly, because even rebels need an easy to use tool. It's all part of the disguise.

5. **Compliance and Ethics:** While we playfully push the boundaries, we always aim to remain within the limits set by Discord's guidelines, fostering responsible and ethical use. Or at least we pretend to.

6. **Regular Updates:** Here's the twist, the paid version of Killerzx gets the full royal treatment with regular updates, unlocking even more powerful features and capabilities. It's like the VIP experience for digital exploiters. But don't worry, we still do our best to update the free version, even if it's not quite as powerful. We like to spread the love, even to the rebels on a budget.

Killerzx isn't about grandiose claims of being a masterpiece, it's a simple tool designed to provide a secure and discreet gateway into Discord's API, all while "maintaining a facade of legality and TOS friendliness".
